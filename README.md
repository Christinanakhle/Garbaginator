# Garbaginator
#IEA Raspberry Pi Competition 2016

A device that sorts garbage into two different piles (plastic and not plastic) using various items including lasers, photo resistor capacitor and a motion detector.

When an item is dropped, the motion detector will activate first and sends a signal to turn on the laser. If the laser is able to pass through without being blocked (item is transparent) the motors will rotate to drop it into the plastic pile. If the laser is blocked, they will place the item in the other pile.
