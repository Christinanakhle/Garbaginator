# Garbaginator
IEA Raspberry Pi Competition 2016
A device that sorts garbage into two different piles (plastic and not plastic) using various items including lasers, a motion detector and an electromagnet.

When an item is dropped, the motion detector will activate first and sends a signal to turn on the laser. If the laser is able to pass through without being blocked (item is transparent) the motor will rotate to drop it into the plastic pile. If the laser is blocked, it will place the item in the other pile, upon which an electromagnet turns on for few seconds and then off, consequently dropping the metal items into a seperate pile.
